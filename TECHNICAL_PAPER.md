# Investigating NoSQL Databases for Improved Performance and Scalability ðŸš€

NoSQL databases are purpose-built for specific data models and store data in flexible schemas that scale easily for modern applications. [NoSQL databases](https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/) are widely recognized for their ease of development, functionality, and performance at scale. This page includes resources to help you better understand `NoSQL databases` and to get started.

## Scenario
In our current project, we are experiencing performance and scaling issues. After conducting an initial analysis, our team lead has suggested that we explore the use of NoSQL databases to address these challenges. This `technical paper` investigates five popular [NoSQL databases](https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/), highlighting their features and use cases to determine their suitability for our project.

## Types of NoSQL Databases

1. **[Document-oriented databases](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/databases/nosql-explained) ðŸ“„**
   - A document-oriented database stores data in documents similar to `JSON objects`. Each document contains pairs of fields and values. The values can typically be a variety of types, including things like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or even other objects. A document database offers a flexible data model, much suited for semi-structured and typically unstructured data sets. They also support nested structures, making it easy to represent complex relationships or `hierarchical data`.

2. **[Key-value databases](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/databases/nosql-explained) ðŸ”‘**
   - A key-value store is a simpler type of database where each item contains `keys and values`. Each key is unique and associated with a single value. They are used for caching and session management and provide `high performance` in reads and writes because they tend to store things in memory. Examples are `Amazon DynamoDB` and Redis.

3. **[Wide-column stores](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/databases/nosql-explained) ðŸ“Š**
   - Wide-column stores store data in tables, rows, and `dynamic columns`. The data is stored in tables. However, unlike traditional SQL databases, wide-column stores are flexible, where different rows can have different sets of columns. These databases can employ column compression techniques to `reduce the storage space` and enhance performance. The wide rows and columns enable efficient retrieval of sparse and wide data. Some examples of wide-column stores are Apache Cassandra and HBase.

4. **[Graph databases](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/databases/nosql-explained) ðŸ”—**
   - A graph database stores data in the form of nodes and edges. `Nodes` typically store information about people, places, and things (like nouns), while edges store information about the relationships between the nodes. They work well for highly connected data, where the relationships or patterns may not be very obvious initially. Examples of graph databases are `Neo4J and Amazon Neptune`.

## Differences between RDBMS and NoSQL databases


| Feature             | NoSQL                                                                                                         | RDBMS                                                                                              |

| Data modeling       | Data models vary based on the type of NoSQL database used â€” for example, key-value, document, graph, and wide-column. | Uses a tabular data structure with data represented as a set of rows and columns.                  |
| Schema              | Provides a flexible schema where each set of documents/row-column/key-value pairs can contain different types of data. | Has a fixed schema where every row should contain the same predefined column types.                |
| Query language      | Varies based on the type of NoSQL database used. MongoDB has MQL, Neo4J uses Cypher, etc.                      | Uses structured query language (SQL).                                                              |

| Distributed computing | Supports distributed data storage, vertical and horizontal scaling through sharding, replication, and clustering. | Supports distributed computing through clustering and replication, but less scalable and flexible. |
| Fault tolerance     | Built-in fault tolerance and high availability due to data replication.                                         | Uses replication, backup, and recovery mechanisms, may require additional disaster recovery measures. |
| Data partitioning   | Done through sharding and replication.                                                                         | Supports table-based partitioning and partition pruning.                                           |
