# NoSQL database

## Overview

In our current project, we are experiencing performance and scaling issues. After conducting an initial analysis, our team lead has suggested that we explore the use of NoSQL databases to address these challenges. This technical paper investigates five popular NoSQL databases—MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, Redis, and Couchbase—highlighting their features and use cases to determine their suitability for our project.

## Objective

The objective of this technical paper is to evaluate MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, Redis, and Couchbase and assess their suitability for our project based on their features and use cases.

## NoSQL Databases Explored

1. **MongoDB**
   - **Features**: MongoDB is known for its flexibility in handling unstructured data and scalability.
   - **Use Cases**: It is suitable for applications requiring high availability and horizontal scaling, such as content management systems and real-time analytics.

2. **Cassandra**
   - **Features**: Cassandra offers high availability, fault tolerance, and linear scalability.
   - **Use Cases**: Ideal for time-series data, messaging apps, and recommendation engines that demand fast writes and reads across large datasets.

3. **Neo4j**
   - **Features**: Neo4j is a graph database optimized for managing and querying highly interconnected data.
   - **Use Cases**: Well-suited for applications involving complex relationships like social networks, fraud detection, and network management.

4. **Redis**
   - **Features**: Redis is an in-memory data structure store known for its speed and versatility.
   - **Use Cases**: Used for caching, real-time analytics, session management, and high-speed transactions where low latency is critical.

5. **Couchbase**
   - **Features**: Couchbase combines key-value and document database capabilities with a distributed architecture.
   - **Use Cases**: Suitable for applications requiring consistent performance, like e-commerce platforms, user profiles, and IoT data storage.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis of MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, Redis, and Couchbase, we will determine the most suitable NoSQL database solution to enhance performance and scalability in our project.
