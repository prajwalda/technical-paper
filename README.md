# NoSQL database

## Overview

In our current project, we are experiencing performance and scaling issues. After conducting an initial analysis, our team lead has suggested that we explore the use of NoSQL databases to address these challenges. This technical paper investigates five popular NoSQL databases—MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, Redis, and Couchbase—highlighting their features and use cases to determine their suitability for our project.

## Objective

The objective of this technical paper is to evaluate MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, Redis, and Couchbase and assess their suitability for our project based on their features and use cases.
